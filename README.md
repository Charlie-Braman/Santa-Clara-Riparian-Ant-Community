# Santa-Clara-Riparian-Ant-Community
Data collected on the incidence of ant encouters and linear vegetative cover at restoration sites along the Santa Clara River in Ventura County, California
## \# Riparian Ant Community Final

These data are ant incidence counts, linear vegetation cover (in
centimeters), and additional environmental descriptive data. Data were
collected on transects along the Santa Clara River in 6 distinct
microhabitats undergoing restoration during/after removal of the
invasive giant reed Arundo donax. Microhabitats were determined by
predominant vegetation and environmental conditions. Data were collected
in the Winter of 2019-2020 and locations were resampled in the Summer of
2020. Data were collected to determine if ant communities differed along
the restoration gradient, and in an attempt to identify which plants
contributed to that differentiation to identify plants that were good
candidates for bolstering the insect community during the restoration
process.

## Description of the data and file structure

Each row of data is a transect location/sample point. Each column is a
species or trait measured at that location at that time point.
